//You can set the following defines (either in code or in the Makefile) to modify the behaviour of the system:
//TWI_FREQ						Set the TWI frequency, in Hz.  Defaults to 400000L (400KHz)
//TWI_BUFFER_LENGTH				Maximum buffer length, in bytes; even needed if you provide custom buffers.  Defaults to 32
//TWI_DISABLE_MASTER			Completely disable master mode
//TWI_DISABLE_SLAVE				Completely disable slave mode
//TWI_DISABLE_SLAVE_RX			Disable RX in slave mode
//TWI_DISABLE_SLAVE_TX			Disable TX in slave mode
//TWI_CUSTOM_BUFFERS			Set a custom buffer for master, slave rx, and slave tx.  See twi_set_*_buffer
//TWI_SLAVE_RX_READER			Set a reader function to handle each byte as it comes in.  See twi_attach_slave_rx_reader
//TWI_MASTER_RX_READER			Set a reader function to handle each byte as it comes in.  See twi_attach_master_rx_reader
//TWI_SLAVE_TX_WRITER			Set a writer function to supply each byte as it is sent.  See twi_attach_slave_tx_writer
//TWI_MASTER_TX_WRITER			Set a writer function to supply each byte as it is sent.  See twi_attach_slave_tx_writer
